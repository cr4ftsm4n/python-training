### Primitive Datatypes and Operators

---

### Data Types

*   Numbers
*   Booleans
*   Strings
*   Lists
*   Tuples
*   Dictionaries

---

### Numbers

1.  Integers
2.  Floats

---

|          | Operation            |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| x + y    | Add                  |
| x - y    | Sub                  |
| -x       | Negate               |
| +x       | Plus                 |
| x \* y   | Multiply             |
| x / y    | Divide               |
| x // y   | Integer Divide(整除) |
| x % y    | Modulo(取余)         |
| x \*\* y | 乗方                 |

### Division with Integers

### python2

```python
5 / 2 = ?
5 // 2 = ?
```

### python3

```python
5 / 2 = ?
5 // 2 = ?
```

---

### Division with Integers

### python2

```python
5 / 2 = 2
5 // 2 = 2
```

### python3

```python
5 / 2 = 2.5
5 // 2 = 2
```

---

### Booleans

*   True
*   False

---

### Booleans

*   True (1)
*   False (0)

---

### Booleans

```python
# Note using Bool operators with ints
# False is 0 and True is 1
# Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise and/or (&,|)
0 and 2     # => 0
-5 or 0     # => -5
0 == False  # => True
2 == True   # => False
1 == True   # => True
-5 != False != True #=> True
```

---

### Booleans

| ==  | Equal to                 |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| !=  | Not equal to             |
| <   | Less than                |
| >   | Greater than             |
| <=  | Less than or equal to    |
| >=  | Greater than or equal to |

---

### Booleans

```python
# (is vs. ==)
# is checks if two variables refer to the same object,
# but == checks if the objects pointed to have the same values.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = a
b is a
b == a
b = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b is a
b == a
```

---

### Booleans

| Operator | What it means                | What it looks like |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| and      | True if both are true        | x and y            |
| or       | True if at least one is true | x or y             |
| not      | True only if false           | not x              |
