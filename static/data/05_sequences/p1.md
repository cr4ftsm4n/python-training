### 可变序列 (mutable sequence)

`Mutable sequences can be changed after they are created.`

*   リスト
*   バイト配列

### リスト(List)

*   The items of a list are arbitrary Python objects.
*   Lists are formed by placing a comma-separated list of expressions in square brackets.

---

### List methods

*   append
*   extend
*   insert
*   pop

### List (Index)処理

```python
li = [1, 2, 3]

# Access a list like you would any array
li[0] # => 1

# Look at the last element
li[-1] # => 3

# Looking out of bounds is an IndexError
li[4] # Raises an IndexError
```

---

### List (Slice) 処理

```python
li = [1, 2, 3]
# You can look at ranges with slice syntax.
# The start index is included, the end index is not
# (It's a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3]   # => [2, 4]
# Omit the beginning and return the list
li[2:]    # => [4, 3]
# Omit the end and return the list
li[:3]    # => [1, 2, 4]
# Select every second entry
li[::2]   # =>[1, 4]
# Return a reversed copy of the list
li[::-1]  # => [3, 4, 2, 1]
# Use any combination of these to make advanced slices
# li[start:end:step]
```

### バイト配列(Byte Arrays)

*   A bytearray object is a mutable array
*   They are created by the built-in bytearray() constructor.
*   Aside from being mutable (and hence unhashable), byte arrays otherwise provide the same interface and functionality as immutable bytes objects.
